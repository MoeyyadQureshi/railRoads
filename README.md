#Railroads

Railroads is a choose your own adventure game about university life. The game is designed to determine how certain decision making behaviours influence the experience a student might have at university.

This game was created at Hack The North 2016! Team members include:
- Moeyyad Qureshi (me)
- Jennifer Anne Reid
- Vinit Soni

My contribution was the machine learning component that analyzes the decisions users make in-game! Check out the modified the modified_knn.py and modified_kmean.py files in the Machine Learning folder under the master branch
